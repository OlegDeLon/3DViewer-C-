In This project i created a programm that can visualise object files, and manipulate with them, using C++ and QtCreator.

I used some base patterns including MVC, Singleton, Facade, Memento.

You can scale, rotate, move object, change type of projection (perspective and parallel), change background and lines color, also you can make a screenshot or gif.

To run 3DViewer you need to download this project and run make, make install from src directory. After that you will see new 3DViewer directory with app on your desktop.
